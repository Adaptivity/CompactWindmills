=======================

Localizations for CompactWindmills

### Notice:

If you want to add a localization file, base it off the en_US.lang file, because tis is the most up-to-date-one.

### Encoding

Make sure, the localization you do is formatted in UTF-8 without BOM. Everything else will most likely not work. If you don't do so, I have to reject your PR!
